# AI-Driven-Personalized-Assessment-Platform
## Project Overview:
Traditional assessment methods often overlook individual learning needs, leading to disengagement and limited academic progress. With the growing demand for personalized education, there is a need for intelligent tools that adapt to each studentâ€™s learning pace and style.
This project aims to develop a smart scholastic assessment platform using NLP and Deep Q-Learning to generate personalized quizzes and provide real-time feedback. By making assessments more adaptive and data-driven, the system supports continuous learning and empowers both students and educators to achieve better educational outcomes.



## Getting Started:
First, setup a virtual environment. Go to your project directory using cd. using the following command: python -m venv venv

Your virtual setup will be complete.

Then
source venv/bin/activate   (if linux/wsl)

or

venv\Scripts\activate     (if windows)

Then
pip install -r requirements.txt


To setup npm, u already have package.json file.
All u need to do is cd to frontend folder then run:
npm install

All dependencies needed will be installed from this in node setup.
